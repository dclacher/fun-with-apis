In this web application, the user can search for a city and the system will provide information about the current weather conditions, as well as general information about the city.
For the weather part, the application connects in the backend to the OpenWeatherMap API. 
To get general information about the city, it connects to the Wikipedia API.

I also used it to explore the functionalities of Heroku cloud environment, by deploying the application to a Heroku server.
